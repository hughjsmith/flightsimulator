## Stack

Stack<Integer> stackofIntegers = new Stack<>();
Stack<String> stackofStrings = new Stack<>();
Use the following code to create a stack of flights
Stack<Flight> incomingFlights = new Stack<>();
Use the following code to add new items to the Stack
IncomingFlights.push(flight);
Use the following code to remove an existing item from the Stack
Flight flight = incomingFlights.pop();
## Queue

Queue.java

The class queue is a collection of items that uses a FIFO (First-in, First-out) policy to insert and remove.

-counter +insert() +moveToFirst() +movetoPrev() +getData
Usage

Queue

-head -counter +Queue() +enque() +dequeue() +peel() +isEmpty() +size()
Implementation

The attribute head represents the front of the queue (first item in the line)

The attribute tail holds represent the back of the queue (last item in the line).

The method Queue() is the constructor and initializes the start of the queue.

The method dequeue() removes an existing item from the queue; items always leave at the front of the queue. It returns the value, and it does not have any parameters. It decreases the counter.

The method enqueue() adds a new item to the queue; new items always join at the back of the queue. It expects the new value but does not have a return value. It increases the counter.

Usage

To create a Queue, use the Queue constructors and indicate the following data type for the items.
Queue<Integer> queueofIntegers = new Queue<>();
Queue<String> queueofStrings = new Queue<>();
Use the following to create a queue of flights.

Use the following code to add a new item flight into the queue.

## List

List.java

The class List is a collection of items. It keeps all items in ascending order. Figure 3 shows the corresponding UML class diagram. The class List is a collection of items. It keeps all items in ascending order. Figure 3 shows the corresponding UML class diagram.

List

-First
Implementation

The attribute first represents the first item in the list. It is the smallest item in the list.

The attribute last represents the last item in the list. It is the largest item in the list.

The attributor iterator represents the current item in the list. It moves through the entire list. It can move forward and backwards.

The attributor counter holds the number of items in the list.

The method insert() adds a new item to the list; new items always join in order. Those methods expect a new value that does not have a return value; it also increases the counter.

The method movetoFirst() moves the iterator to the first item in the list.

The method movetoLast() moves the iterator to the last item in the list.

The method move to next() moves the iterator to the next item in the list

The method getdata() returns the item pointed by the current iterator

The method hasdata() returns true if the current iterator points to a valid item in the list; otherwise, it returns false.

The method isEmpty() returns a Boolean value that indicates if the list has any item it returns.

The method size() returns an integer value that indicates the number of items currently in the list; it returns zero if the list is empty.

To create a list, use the list constructor and indicate the data type for the target items as follows:
List<String> listofString = new List<>();
Use the following code to add a new item (flight object) to the list.

Use the following code to loop through a list of flights where buffer is an output file:

Use the following code to print all the content of the list

Java II

Stack.java

The class Stack is a collection of items. It uses a FILO policy to insert and remove.

Figure 1 shows the corresponding UML class diagram.

Stack

-top -counter +push() +peel() +isEmpty() +size()
Implementation

The attribute top represents the top of the Stack.

The attribute counter holds the number of items in the Stack.

The method Stack() is the constructor and initializes the state of the Stack.

The method push() adds a new item to the Stack. It expects the new value and does not have a return value. It increases the counter.

The method pop() removes an existing item from the Stack. It returns the removed value, and it does not have any parameters. It decreases the counter.

The method peek() returns the value at the top of the Stack and has no parameters.

The method isEmpty() returns a Boolean value that indicates if the Stack has any items. It returns true if the Stack is empty; otherwise, it returns false.
